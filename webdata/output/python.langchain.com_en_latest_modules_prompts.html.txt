Conceptual Guide
The new way of programming models is through prompts.
A
prompt
refers to the input to the model.
This input is often constructed from multiple components.
A
PromptTemplate
is responsible for the construction of this input.
LangChain provides several classes and functions to make constructing and working with prompts easy.
Getting Started
: An overview of the prompts.
LLM Prompt Templates
: How to use PromptTemplates to prompt Language Models.
Chat Prompt Templates
: How to use PromptTemplates to prompt Chat Models.
Example Selectors
: Often times it is useful to include examples in prompts.
These examples can be dynamically selected. This section goes over example selection.
Output Parsers
: Language models (and Chat Models) output text.
But many times you may want to get more structured information. This is where output parsers come in.
Output Parsers:
instruct the model how output should be formatted,
parse output into the desired formatting (including retrying if necessary).
