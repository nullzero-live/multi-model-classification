Calling a model
Replicate
#
This page covers how to run models on Replicate within LangChain.
Installation and Setup
#
Create a
Replicate
account. Get your API key and set it as an environment variable (
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN
)
Install the
Replicate python client
with
pip
install
replicate
Calling a model
#
Find a model on the
Replicate explore page
, and then paste in the model name and version in this format:
owner-name/model-name:version
For example, for this
dolly model
, click on the API tab. The model name/version would be:
"replicate/dolly-v2-12b:ef0e1aefc61f8e096ebe4db6b2bacc297daf2ef6899f0f7e001ec445893500e5"
Only the
model
param is required, but any other model parameters can also be passed in with the format
input={model_param:
value,
...}
For example, if we were running stable diffusion and wanted to change the image dimensions:
Replicate
(
model
=
"stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf"
,
input
=
{
'image_dimensions'
:
'512x512'
})
Note that only the first output of a model will be returned.
From here, we can initialize our model:
llm
=
Replicate
(
model
=
"replicate/dolly-v2-12b:ef0e1aefc61f8e096ebe4db6b2bacc297daf2ef6899f0f7e001ec445893500e5"
)
And run it:
prompt
=
"""
Answer the following yes/no question by reasoning step by step.
Can a dog drive a car?
"""
llm
(
prompt
)
We can call any Replicate model (not just LLMs) using this syntax. For example, we can call
Stable Diffusion
:
text2image
=
Replicate
(
model
=
"stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf"
,
input
=
{
'image_dimensions'
:
'512x512'
})
image_output
=
text2image
(
"A cat riding a motorcycle by Picasso"
)
