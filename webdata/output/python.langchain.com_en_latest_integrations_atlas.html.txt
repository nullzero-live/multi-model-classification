Wrappers
#
VectorStore
#
There exists a wrapper around the Atlas neural database, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore.
This vectorstore also gives you full access to the underlying AtlasProject object, which will allow you to use the full range of Atlas map interactions, such as bulk tagging and automatic topic modeling.
Please see
the Atlas docs
for more detailed information.
To import this vectorstore:
from
langchain.vectorstores
import
AtlasDB
For a more detailed walkthrough of the AtlasDB wrapper, see
