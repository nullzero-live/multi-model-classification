Conceptual Guide
Combining language models with your own text data is a powerful way to differentiate them.
The first step in doing this is to load the data into “Documents” - a fancy way of say some pieces of text.
The document loader is aimed at making this easy.
The following document loaders are provided:
Transform loaders
#
These
transform
loaders transform data from a specific format into the Document format.
For example, there are
transformers
for CSV and SQL.
Mostly, these loaders input data from files but sometime from URLs.
A primary driver of a lot of these transformers is the
Unstructured
python package.
This package transforms many types of files - text, powerpoint, images, html, pdf, etc - into text data.
For detailed instructions on how to get set up with Unstructured, see installation guidelines

Proprietary dataset or service loaders
#
These datasets and services are not from the public domain.
These loaders mostly transform data from specific formats of applications or cloud services,
for example
Google Drive
.
We need access tokens and sometime other parameters to get access to these datasets and services.
