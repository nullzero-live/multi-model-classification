Hugging Face
#
This page covers how to use the Hugging Face ecosystem (including the
Hugging Face Hub
) within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific Hugging Face wrappers.
Installation and Setup
#
If you want to work with the Hugging Face Hub:
Install the Hub client library with
pip
install
huggingface_hub
Create a Hugging Face account (it’s free!)
Create an
access token
and set it as an environment variable (
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN
)
If you want work with the Hugging Face Python libraries:
Install
pip
install
transformers
for working with models and tokenizers
Install
pip
install
datasets
for working with datasets
Wrappers
#
LLM
#
There exists two Hugging Face LLM wrappers, one for a local pipeline and one for a model hosted on Hugging Face Hub.
Note that these wrappers only work for models that support the following tasks:
text2text-generation
,
text-generation
To use the local pipeline wrapper:
from
langchain.llms
import
HuggingFacePipeline
To use a the wrapper for a model hosted on Hugging Face Hub:
from
langchain.llms
import
HuggingFaceHub
For a more detailed walkthrough of the Hugging Face Hub wrapper, see
this notebook
Embeddings
#
There exists two Hugging Face Embeddings wrappers, one for a local model and one for a model hosted on Hugging Face Hub.
Note that these wrappers only work for
sentence-transformers
models
.
To use the local pipeline wrapper:
from
langchain.embeddings
import
HuggingFaceEmbeddings
To use a the wrapper for a model hosted on Hugging Face Hub:
from
langchain.embeddings
import
HuggingFaceHubEmbeddings
For a more detailed walkthrough of this, see
this notebook
Tokenizer
#
There are several places you can use tokenizers available through the
transformers
package.
By default, it is used to count tokens for all LLMs.
You can also use it to count tokens when splitting documents with
from
langchain.text_splitter
import
CharacterTextSplitter
CharacterTextSplitter
.
from_huggingface_tokenizer
(
...
)
For a more detailed walkthrough of this, see
this notebook
Datasets
#
The Hugging Face Hub has lots of great
datasets
that can be used to evaluate your LLM chains.
For a detailed walkthrough of how to use them to do so, see
