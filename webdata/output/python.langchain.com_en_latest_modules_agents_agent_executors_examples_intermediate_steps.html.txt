How to access intermediate steps
#
In order to get more visibility into what an agent is doing, we can also return intermediate steps. This comes in the form of an extra key in the return value, which is a list of (action, observation) tuples.

I should look up who Leo DiCaprio is dating
Action: Search
Action Input: "Leo DiCaprio girlfriend"
Observation:
Camila Morrone
Thought:
I should look up how old Camila Morrone is
Action: Search
Action Input: "Camila Morrone age"
Observation:
25 years
Thought:
I should calculate what 25 years raised to the 0.43 power is
Action: Calculator
Action Input: 25^0.43
Observation:
Answer: 3.991298452658078
Thought:
I now know the final answer
Final Answer: Camila Morrone is Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend and she is 3.991298452658078 years old.
