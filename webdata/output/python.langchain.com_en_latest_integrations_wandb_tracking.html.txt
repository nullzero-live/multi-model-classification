Weights & Biases
Weights & Biases
#
This notebook goes over how to track your LangChain experiments into one centralized Weights and Biases dashboard. To learn more about prompt engineering and the callback please refer to this Report which explains both alongside the resultant dashboards you can expect to see.

Note
:
the
WandbCallbackHandler
is being deprecated in favour of the
WandbTracer
. In future please use the
WandbTracer
as it is more flexible and allows for more granular logging. To know more about the
WandbTracer
refer to the
agent_with_wandb_tracing.ipynb
notebook or use the following
colab notebook
. To know more about Weights & Biases Prompts refer to the following

The
flush_tracker
function is used to log LangChain sessions to Weights & Biases. It takes in the LangChain module or agent, and logs at minimum the prompts and generations alongside the serialized form of the LangChain module to the specified Weights & Biases project. By default we reset the session as opposed to concluding the session outright.

I need to find out who Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend is and then calculate her age raised to the 0.43 power.
Action: Search
Action Input: "Leo DiCaprio girlfriend"
Observation:
DiCaprio had a steady girlfriend in Camila Morrone. He had been with the model turned actress for nearly five years, as they were first said to be dating at the end of 2017. And the now 26-year-old Morrone is no stranger to Hollywood.
Thought:
I need to calculate her age raised to the 0.43 power.
Action: Calculator
Action Input: 26^0.43
Observation:
Answer: 4.059182145592686
Thought:
I now know the final answer.
Final Answer: Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend is Camila Morrone and her current age raised to the 0.43 power is 4.059182145592686.
