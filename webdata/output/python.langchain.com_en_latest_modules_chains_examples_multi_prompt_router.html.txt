Router Chains: Selecting from multiple prompts with MultiPromptChain
Router Chains: Selecting from multiple prompts with MultiPromptChain
#
This notebook demonstrates how to use the
RouterChain
paradigm to create a chain that dynamically selects the prompt to use for a given input. Specifically we show how to use the
MultiPromptChain
to create a question-answering chain that selects the prompt which is most relevant for a given question, and then answers the question using that prompt.

Black body radiation is the emission of electromagnetic radiation from a body due to its temperature. It is a type of thermal radiation that is emitted from the surface of all objects that are at a temperature above absolute zero. It is a spectrum of radiation that is influenced by the temperature of the body and is independent of the composition of the emitting material.

?

The first prime number greater than 40 such that one plus the prime number is divisible by 3 is 43. To solve this problem, we can break down the question into two parts: finding the first prime number greater than 40, and then finding a number that is divisible by 3. 

The first step is to find the first prime number greater than 40. A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself. The next prime number after 40 is 41.

The second step is to find a number that is divisible by 3. To do this, we can add 1 to 41, which gives us 42. Now, we can check if 42 is divisible by 3. 42 divided by 3 is 14, so 42 is divisible by 3.

Therefore, the answer to the question is 43.

The type of cloud that typically produces rain is called a cumulonimbus cloud. This type of cloud is characterized by its large vertical extent and can produce thunderstorms and heavy precipitation. Is there anything else you'd like to know?
