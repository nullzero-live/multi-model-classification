Stripe
is an Irish-American financial services and software as a service (SaaS) company. It offers payment-processing software and application programming interfaces for e-commerce websites and mobile applications.
This notebook covers how to load data from the

into a format that can be ingested into LangChain, along with example usage for vectorization.

langchain.document_loaders
