This page covers how to use the Deep Lake ecosystem within LangChain.
Why Deep Lake?

More than just a (multi-modal) vector store. You can later use the dataset to fine-tune your own LLM models.
Not only stores embeddings, but also the original data with automatic version control.
Truly serverless. Doesn’t require another service and can be used with major cloud providers (AWS S3, GCS, etc.)
