Copy Paste
#
This notebook covers how to load a document object from something you just want to copy and paste. In this case, you don’t even need to use a DocumentLoader, but rather can just construct the Document directly.
from
langchain.docstore.document
import
Document
text
=
"..... put the text you copy pasted here......"
doc
=
Document
(
page_content
=
text
)
