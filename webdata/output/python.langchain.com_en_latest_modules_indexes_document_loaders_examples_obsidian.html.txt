#
Obsidian
is a powerful and extensible knowledge base
that works on top of your local folder of plain text files.
This notebook covers how to load documents from an
Obsidian
database.
Since
Obsidian
is just stored on disk as a folder of Markdown files, the loader just takes a path to this directory.
Obsidian
files also sometimes contain
metadata
which is a YAML block at the top of the file. These values will be added to the document’s metadata. (
ObsidianLoader
can also be passed a
collect_metadata=False
argument to disable this behavior.)
