CoNLL-U
CoNLL-U
#
CoNLL-U
is revised version of the CoNLL-X format. Annotations are encoded in plain text files (UTF-8, normalized to NFC, using only the LF character as line break, including an LF character at the end of file) with three types of lines:
Word lines containing the annotation of a word/token in 10 fields separated by single tab characters; see below.
Blank lines marking sentence boundaries.
Comment lines starting with hash (#).
This is an example of how to load a file in
CoNLL-U
format. The whole file is treated as one document. The example data (
conllu.conllu
) is based on one of the standard UD/CoNLL-U examples.
