This page covers how to use the
Serper
Google Search API within LangChain. Serper is a low-cost Google Search API that can be used to add answer box, knowledge graph, and organic results data from Google Search.
It is broken into two parts: setup, and then references to the specific Google Serper wrapper.
Setup
#
Go to
serper.dev
to sign up for a free account
Get the api key and set it as an environment variable (
SERPER_API_KEY
)
