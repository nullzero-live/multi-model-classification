Sentence Transformers
#
Sentence Transformers
embeddings are called using the
HuggingFaceEmbeddings
integration. We have also added an alias for
SentenceTransformerEmbeddings
for users who are more familiar with directly using that package.
SentenceTransformers is a python package that can generate text and image embeddings, originating from
Sentence-BERT
!
