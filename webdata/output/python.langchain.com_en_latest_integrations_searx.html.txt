SearxNG Search API
#
This page covers how to use the SearxNG search API within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to the specific SearxNG API wrapper.
Installation and Setup
#
While it is possible to utilize the wrapper in conjunction with
public searx
instances
these instances frequently do not permit API
access (see note on output format below) and have limitations on the frequency
of requests. It is recommended to opt for a self-hosted instance instead.
Self Hosted Instance:
#
See
this page
for installation instructions.
When you install SearxNG, the only active output format by default is the HTML format.
You need to activate the
json
format to use the API. This can be done by adding the following line to the
settings.yml
file:
search
:
formats
:
-
html
-
json
You can make sure that the API is working by issuing a curl request to the API endpoint:
curl
-kLX
GET
--data-urlencode
q='langchain'
-d
format=json
http://localhost:8888
This should return a JSON object with the results.
Wrappers
#
Utility
#
To use the wrapper we need to pass the host of the SearxNG instance to the wrapper with:
1. the named parameter
searx_host
when creating the instance.
2. exporting the environment variable
SEARXNG_HOST
.
You can use the wrapper to get results from a SearxNG instance.
from
langchain.utilities
import
SearxSearchWrapper
s
=
SearxSearchWrapper
(
searx_host
=
"http://localhost:8888"
)
s
.
run
(
"what is a large language model?"
)
Tool
#
You can also load this wrapper as a Tool (to use with an Agent).
You can do this with:
from
langchain.agents
import
load_tools
tools
=
load_tools
([
"searx-search"
],
searx_host
=
"http://localhost:8888"
,
engines
=
[
"github"
])
Note that we could
optionally
pass custom engines to use.
If you want to obtain results with metadata as
json
you can use:
tools
=
load_tools
([
"searx-search-results-json"
],
searx_host
=
"http://localhost:8888"
,
num_results
=
5
)
