Pandas Dataframe Agent
#
This notebook shows how to use agents to interact with a pandas dataframe. It is mostly optimized for question answering.
NOTE: this agent calls the Python agent under the hood, which executes LLM generated Python code - this can be bad if the LLM generated Python code is harmful. Use cautiously.

.
run
(
"how many rows in the age column are different?"
)
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
Thought: I need to compare the age columns in both dataframes
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: len(df1[df1['Age'] != df2['Age']])
Observation:

Thought:
I now know the final answer
Final Answer: 177 rows in the age column are different.
