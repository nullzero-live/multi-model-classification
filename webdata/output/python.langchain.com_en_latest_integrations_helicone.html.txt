This page covers how to use the
Helicone
ecosystem within LangChain.
What is Helicone?
#
Helicone is an
open source
observability platform that proxies your OpenAI traffic and provides you key insights into your spend, latency and usage.
Quick start
#
With your LangChain environment you can just add the following parameter.
export
OPENAI_API_BASE
=
"https://oai.hconeai.com/v1"
Now head over to
helicone.ai
to create your account, and add your OpenAI API key within our dashboard to view your logs.
