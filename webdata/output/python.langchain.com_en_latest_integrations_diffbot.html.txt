Diffbot
is a service to read web pages. Unlike traditional web scraping tools,
Diffbot
doesn’t require any rules to read the content on a page.
It starts with computer vision, which classifies a page into one of 20 possible types. Content is then interpreted by a machine learning model trained to identify the key attributes on a page based on its type.
The result is a website transformed into clean-structured data (like JSON or CSV), ready for your application.
