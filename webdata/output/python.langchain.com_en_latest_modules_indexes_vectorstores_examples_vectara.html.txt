Vectara
#
Vectara
is a API platform for building LLM-powered applications. It provides a simple to use API for document indexing and query that is managed by Vectara and is optimized for performance and accuracy.
This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the
Vectara
vector database.
See the
Vectara API documentation
for more information on how to use the API.
We want to use
OpenAIEmbeddings
so we have to get the OpenAI API Key.

The simplest scenario for using Vectara is to perform a similarity search.

Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence. A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender.
Similarity search with score

Sometimes we might want to perform the search, but also obtain a relevancy score to know how good is a particular result.
