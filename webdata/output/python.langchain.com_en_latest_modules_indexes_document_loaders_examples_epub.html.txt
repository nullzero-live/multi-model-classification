EPUB
is an e-book file format that uses the “.epub” file extension. The term is short for electronic publication and is sometimes styled ePub.
EPUB
is supported by many e-readers, and compatible software is available for most smartphones, tablets, and computers.
This covers how to load
.epub
documents into the Document format that we can use downstream. You’ll need to install the
pandocs
package for this loader to work.
#!pip install pandocs
from
langchain.document_loaders
import
UnstructuredEPubLoader
loader
=
UnstructuredEPubLoader
(
"winter-sports.epub"
)
data
=
loader
.
load

Under the hood, Unstructured creates different “elements” for different chunks of text. By default we combine those together, but you can easily keep that separation by specifying
mode="elements"
.
loader
=
UnstructuredEPubLoader
(
"winter-sports.epub"
,
mode
=
"elements"
)
