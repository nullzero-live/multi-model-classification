StochasticAI
#
Stochastic Acceleration Platform
aims to simplify the life cycle of a Deep Learning model. From uploading and versioning the model, through training, compression and acceleration to putting it into production.
This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with
StochasticAI
models.
You have to get the API_KEY and the API_URL
here
