Azure Cognitive Search
#
Azure Cognitive Search
(formerly known as
Azure
Search
) is a cloud search service that gives developers infrastructure, APIs, and tools for building a rich search experience over private, heterogeneous content in web, mobile, and enterprise applications.
Search is foundational to any app that surfaces text to users, where common scenarios include catalog or document search, online retail apps, or data exploration over proprietary content. When you create a search service, you’ll work with the following capabilities:
A search engine for full text search over a search index containing user-owned content
Rich indexing, with lexical analysis and optional AI enrichment for content extraction and transformation
Rich query syntax for text search, fuzzy search, autocomplete, geo-search and more
Programmability through REST APIs and client libraries in Azure SDKs
Azure integration at the data layer, machine learning layer, and AI (Cognitive Services)
This notebook shows how to use Azure Cognitive Search (ACS) within LangChain.
