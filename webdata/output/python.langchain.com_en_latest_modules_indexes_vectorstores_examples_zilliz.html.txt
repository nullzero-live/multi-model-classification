#
Zilliz Cloud
is a fully managed service on cloud for
LF
AI
Milvus®
,
This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the Zilliz Cloud managed vector database.
To run, you should have a
Zilliz
Cloud
instance up and running. Here are the
installation instructions
!
pip
install
pymilvus
We want to use
OpenAIEmbeddings
so we have to get the OpenAI API Key.

'Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. \n\nTonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \n\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \n\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.'
