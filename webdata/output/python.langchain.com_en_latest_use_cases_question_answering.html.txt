Question Answering over Docs
#
Conceptual Guide
Question answering in this context refers to question answering over your document data.
For question answering over other types of data, please see other sources documentation like
SQL database Question Answering
or
Interacting with APIs
.
For question answering over many documents, you almost always want to create an index over the data.
This can be used to smartly access the most relevant documents for a given question, allowing you to avoid having to pass all the documents to the LLM (saving you time and money).
See
this notebook
for a more detailed introduction to this, but for a super quick start the steps involved are:
Load Your Documents
from
langchain.document_loaders
import
TextLoader
loader
=
TextLoader
(
'../state_of_the_union.txt'
)
See
here
for more information on how to get started with document loading.
Create Your Index
from
langchain.indexes
import
VectorstoreIndexCreator
index
=
VectorstoreIndexCreator
()
.
from_loaders
([
loader
])
The best and most popular index by far at the moment is the VectorStore index.
Query Your Index
query
=
"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
index
.
query
(
query
)
Alternatively, use
query_with_sources
to also get back the sources involved
query
=
"What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
index
.
query_with_sources
(
query
)
Again, these high level interfaces obfuscate a lot of what is going on under the hood, so please see
this notebook
for a lower level walkthrough.
Document Question Answering
#
Question answering involves fetching multiple documents, and then asking a question of them.
The LLM response will contain the answer to your question, based on the content of the documents.
The recommended way to get started using a question answering chain is:
from
langchain.chains.question_answering
import
load_qa_chain
chain
=
load_qa_chain
(
llm
,
chain_type
=
"stuff"
)
chain
.
run
(
input_documents
=
docs
,
question
=
query
)
The following resources exist:
Question Answering Notebook
: A notebook walking through how to accomplish this task.
VectorDB Question Answering Notebook
: A notebook walking through how to do question answering over a vector database. This can often be useful for when you have a LOT of documents, and you don’t want to pass them all to the LLM, but rather first want to do some semantic search over embeddings.
Adding in sources
#
There is also a variant of this, where in addition to responding with the answer the language model will also cite its sources (eg which of the documents passed in it used).
The recommended way to get started using a question answering with sources chain is:
from
langchain.chains.qa_with_sources
import
load_qa_with_sources_chain
chain
=
load_qa_with_sources_chain
(
llm
,
chain_type
=
"stuff"
)
chain
({
"input_documents"
:
docs
,
"question"
:
query
},
return_only_outputs
=
True
)

: A notebook walking through how to accomplish this task.

: A notebook walking through how to do question answering with sources over a vector database. This can often be useful for when you have a LOT of documents, and you don’t want to pass them all to the LLM, but rather first want to do some semantic search over embeddings.
