Apify Dataset
#
Apify Dataset
is a scaleable append-only storage with sequential access built for storing structured web scraping results, such as a list of products or Google SERPs, and then export them to various formats like JSON, CSV, or Excel. Datasets are mainly used to save results of
Apify Actors
—serverless cloud programs for varius web scraping, crawling, and data extraction use cases.
This notebook shows how to load Apify datasets to LangChain.
Prerequisites
#
You need to have an existing dataset on the Apify platform. If you don’t have one, please first check out
this notebook
on how to use Apify to extract content from documentation, knowledge bases, help centers, or blogs.
#!pip install apify-client
First, import
ApifyDatasetLoader
into your source code:
from
langchain.document_loaders
import
ApifyDatasetLoader
from
langchain.document_loaders.base
import
Document
Then provide a function that maps Apify dataset record fields to LangChain
Document
format.
For example, if your dataset items are structured like this:
{
"url"
:
"https://apify.com"
,
"text"
:
"Apify is the best web scraping and automation platform."
}
The mapping function in the code below will convert them to LangChain
Document
format, so that you can use them further with any LLM model (e.g. for question answering).
loader
=
ApifyDatasetLoader
(
dataset_id
=
"your-dataset-id"
,
dataset_mapping_function
=
lambda
dataset_item
:
Document
(
page_content
=
dataset_item
[
"text"
],
metadata
=
{
"source"
:
dataset_item
[
"url"
]}
),
)
data
=
loader
.
load
()
An example with question answering
#
In this example, we use data from a dataset to answer a question.
from
langchain.docstore.document
import
Document
from
langchain.document_loaders
import
ApifyDatasetLoader
from
langchain.indexes
import
VectorstoreIndexCreator
loader
=
ApifyDatasetLoader
(
dataset_id
=
"your-dataset-id"
,
dataset_mapping_function
=
lambda
item
:
Document
(
page_content
=
item
[
"text"
]
or
""
,
metadata
=
{
"source"
:
item
[
"url"
]}
),
)
index
=
VectorstoreIndexCreator
()
.
from_loaders
([
loader
])
query
=
"What is Apify?"
result
=
index
.
query_with_sources
(
query
)
print
(
result
[
"answer"
])
print
(
result
[
"sources"
])
Apify is a platform for developing, running, and sharing serverless cloud programs. It enables users to create web scraping and automation tools and publish them on the Apify platform.
