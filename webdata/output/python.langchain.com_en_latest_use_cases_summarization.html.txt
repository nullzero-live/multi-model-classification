Conceptual Guide
Summarization involves creating a smaller summary of multiple longer documents.
This can be useful for distilling long documents into the core pieces of information.
The recommended way to get started using a summarization chain is:
from
langchain.chains.summarize
import
load_summarize_chain
chain
=
load_summarize_chain
(
llm
,
chain_type
=
"map_reduce"
)
chain
.
run
(
docs
)
The following resources exist:
Summarization Notebook
: A notebook walking through how to accomplish this task.

: Guides on how to use several of the utilities which will prove helpful for this task, including Text Splitters (for splitting up long documents).
