CSV Agent
#
This notebook shows how to use agents to interact with a csv. It is mostly optimized for question answering.
NOTE: this agent calls the Pandas DataFrame agent under the hood, which in turn calls the Python agent, which executes LLM generated Python code - this can be bad if the LLM generated Python code is harmful. Use cautiously.

Multi CSV Example
#
This next part shows how the agent can interact with multiple csv files passed in as a list.
agent
=
create_csv_agent
(
OpenAI
(
temperature
=
0
),
[
'titanic.csv'
,
'titanic_age_fillna.csv'
],
verbose
=
True
)
agent
.
run
(
"how many rows in the age column are different?"
)
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
Thought: I need to compare the age columns in both dataframes
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: len(df1[df1['Age'] != df2['Age']])
Observation:
177
Thought:
I now know the final answer
Final Answer: 177 rows in the age column are different.
> Finished chain.
'177 rows in the age column are different.'
