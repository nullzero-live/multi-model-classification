ReadTheDocs Documentation
#
Read the Docs
is an open-sourced free software documentation hosting platform. It generates documentation written with the
Sphinx
documentation generator.
This notebook covers how to load content from HTML that was generated as part of a
Read-The-Docs
build.
For an example of this in the wild, see
here
.
This assumes that the HTML has already been scraped into a folder. This can be done by uncommenting and running the following command
#!pip install beautifulsoup4
#!wget -r -A.html -P rtdocs https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
from
langchain.document_loaders
