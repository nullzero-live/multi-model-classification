Aleph Alpha
#
There are two possible ways to use Aleph Alpha’s semantic embeddings. If you have texts with a dissimilar structure (e.g. a Document and a Query) you would want to use asymmetric embeddings. Conversely, for texts with comparable structures, symmetric embeddings are the suggested approach.
Asymmetric
#
from
langchain.embeddings
import
AlephAlphaAsymmetricSemanticEmbedding
document
=
"This is a content of the document"
query
=
"What is the contnt of the document?"
embeddings
=
AlephAlphaAsymmetricSemanticEmbedding
()
doc_result
=
embeddings
.
embed_documents
([
document
])
query_result
=
embeddings
.
embed_query
(
query
)
Symmetric
#
from
langchain.embeddings
import
AlephAlphaSymmetricSemanticEmbedding
text
=
"This is a test text"
embeddings
=
AlephAlphaSymmetricSemanticEmbedding
()
doc_result
=
embeddings
.
embed_documents
([
text
])
query_result
=
embeddings
.
embed_query
(
text
)
