PipelineAI
#
PipelineAI allows you to run your ML models at scale in the cloud. It also provides API access to
several LLM models
.
This notebook goes over how to use Langchain with
PipelineAI
.
Install pipeline-ai
#
The
pipeline-ai
library is required to use the
PipelineAI
API, AKA
Pipeline
Cloud
. Install
pipeline-ai
using
pip
install
pipeline-ai
.
# Install the package
!
pip
install
pipeline-ai
Imports
#
import
os
from
langchain.llms
import
PipelineAI
from
langchain
import
PromptTemplate
,
LLMChain
Set the Environment API Key
#
Make sure to get your API key from PipelineAI. Check out the
cloud quickstart guide
. You’ll be given a 30 day free trial with 10 hours of serverless GPU compute to test different models.

[
"PIPELINE_API_KEY"

Create the PipelineAI instance
#
When instantiating PipelineAI, you need to specify the id or tag of the pipeline you want to use, e.g.
pipeline_key
=
"public/gpt-j:base"
. You then have the option of passing additional pipeline-specific keyword arguments:
llm
=
PipelineAI
(
pipeline_key
=
"YOUR_PIPELINE_KEY"
,
pipeline_kwargs
=
{
...
})
Create a Prompt Template
#
We will create a prompt template for Question and Answer.
template
=
"""Question:
{question}
Answer: Let's think step by step."""
prompt
=
PromptTemplate
(
template
=
template
,
input_variables
=
[
"question"
])
Initiate the LLMChain
#
llm_chain
=
LLMChain
(
prompt
=
prompt
,
llm
=
llm
)
Run the LLMChain
#
Provide a question and run the LLMChain.
question
=
"What NFL team won the Super Bowl in the year Justin Beiber was born?"
llm_chain
.
