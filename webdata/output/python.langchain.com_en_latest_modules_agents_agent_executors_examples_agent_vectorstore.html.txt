How to combine agents and vectorstores
#
This notebook covers how to combine agents and vectorstores. The use case for this is that you’ve ingested your data into a vectorstore and want to interact with it in an agentic manner.
The recommended method for doing so is to create a RetrievalQA and then use that as a tool in the overall agent. Let’s take a look at doing this below. You can do this with multiple different vectordbs, and use the agent as a way to route between them. There are two different ways of doing this - you can either let the agent use the vectorstores as normal tools, or you can set
return_direct=True
to really just use the agent as a router.

I need to find out what Biden said about Ketanji Brown Jackson in the State of the Union address.
Action: State of Union QA System
Action Input: What did Biden say about Ketanji Brown Jackson in the State of the Union address?
Observation:
Biden said that Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds and that she will continue Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence.
Thought:
I now know the final answer
Final Answer: Biden said that Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds and that she will continue Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence.

"Why use ruff over flake8?"

I need to find out the advantages of using ruff over flake8
Action: Ruff QA System
Action Input: What are the advantages of using ruff over flake8?
Observation:
Ruff can be used as a drop-in replacement for Flake8 when used (1) without or with a small number of plugins, (2) alongside Black, and (3) on Python 3 code. It also re-implements some of the most popular Flake8 plugins and related code quality tools natively, including isort, yesqa, eradicate, and most of the rules implemented in pyupgrade. Ruff also supports automatically fixing its own lint violations, which Flake8 does not.

Use the Agent solely as a router
#
You can also set
return_direct=True
if you intend to use the agent as a router and just want to directly return the result of the RetrievalQAChain.
Notice that in the above examples the agent did some extra work after querying the RetrievalQAChain. You can avoid that and just return the result directly.

Because vectorstores are easily usable as tools in agents, it is easy to use answer multi-hop questions that depend on vectorstores using the existing agent framework

> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
I need to find out what tool ruff uses to run over Jupyter Notebooks, and if the president mentioned it in the state of the union.
Action: Ruff QA System
Action Input: What tool does ruff use to run over Jupyter Notebooks?
Observation:
Ruff is integrated into nbQA, a tool for running linters and code formatters over Jupyter Notebooks. After installing ruff and nbqa, you can run Ruff over a notebook like so: > nbqa ruff Untitled.ipynb
Thought:
I now need to find out if the president mentioned this tool in the state of the union.
Action: State of Union QA System
Action Input: Did the president mention nbQA in the state of the union?
Observation:
No, the president did not mention nbQA in the state of the union.
Thought:
I now know the final answer.
Final Answer: No, the president did not mention nbQA in the state of the union.
> Finished chain.
'No, the president did not mention nbQA in the state of the union.'
