Microsoft OneDrive
#
Microsoft OneDrive
(formerly
SkyDrive
) is a file hosting service operated by Microsoft.
This notebook covers how to load documents from
OneDrive
. Currently, only docx, doc, and pdf files are supported.
Prerequisites
#
Register an application with the
Microsoft identity platform
instructions.
When registration finishes, the Azure portal displays the app registration’s Overview pane. You see the Application (client) ID. Also called the
client
ID
, this value uniquely identifies your application in the Microsoft identity platform.
During the steps you will be following at
item 1
, you can set the redirect URI as
http://localhost:8000/callback
During the steps you will be following at
item 1
, generate a new password (
client_secret
) under Application Secrets section.
Follow the instructions at this
document
to add the following
SCOPES
(
offline_access
and
Files.Read.All
) to your application.
Visit the
Graph Explorer Playground
to obtain your
OneDrive
ID
. The first step is to ensure you are logged in with the account associated your OneDrive account. Then you need to make a request to
https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive
and the response will return a payload with a field
id
that holds the ID of your OneDrive account.
You need to install the o365 package using the command
pip
install
o365
.
At the end of the steps you must have the following values:
CLIENT_ID
CLIENT_SECRET
DRIVE_ID

🔑 Authentication
#
By default, the
OneDriveLoader
expects that the values of
CLIENT_ID
and
CLIENT_SECRET
must be stored as environment variables named
O365_CLIENT_ID
and
O365_CLIENT_SECRET
respectively. You could pass those environment variables through a
.env
file at the root of your application or using the following command in your script.
os
.
environ
[
'O365_CLIENT_ID'
]
=
"YOUR CLIENT ID"
os
.
environ
[
'O365_CLIENT_SECRET'
]
=
"YOUR CLIENT SECRET"
This loader uses an authentication called
on behalf of a user
. It is a 2 step authentication with user consent. When you instantiate the loader, it will call will print a url that the user must visit to give consent to the app on the required permissions. The user must then visit this url and give consent to the application. Then the user must copy the resulting page url and paste it back on the console. The method will then return True if the login attempt was succesful.
from
langchain.document_loaders.onedrive
import
OneDriveLoader
loader
=
OneDriveLoader
(
drive_id
=
"YOUR DRIVE ID"
)
Once the authentication has been done, the loader will store a token (
o365_token.txt
) at
~/.credentials/
folder. This token could be used later to authenticate without the copy/paste steps explained earlier. To use this token for authentication, you need to change the
auth_with_token
parameter to True in the instantiation of the loader.
from
langchain.document_loaders.onedrive
import
OneDriveLoader
loader
=
OneDriveLoader
(
drive_id
=
"YOUR DRIVE ID"
,
auth_with_token
=
True
)
🗂️ Documents loader
#
📑 Loading documents from a OneDrive Directory
#
OneDriveLoader
can load documents from a specific folder within your OneDrive. For instance, you want to load all documents that are stored at
Documents/clients
folder within your OneDrive.
from
langchain.document_loaders.onedrive
import
OneDriveLoader
loader
=
OneDriveLoader
(
drive_id
=
"YOUR DRIVE ID"
,
folder_path
=
"Documents/clients"
,
auth_with_token
=
True
)
documents
=
loader
.
load
()
📑 Loading documents from a list of Documents IDs
#
Another possibility is to provide a list of
object_id
for each document you want to load. For that, you will need to query the
Microsoft Graph API
to find all the documents ID that you are interested in. This
link
provides a list of endpoints that will be helpful to retrieve the documents ID.
For instance, to retrieve information about all objects that are stored at the root of the Documents folder, you need make a request to:
https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/drives/{YOUR
DRIVE
ID}/root/children
. Once you have the list of IDs that you are interested in, then you can instantiate the loader with the following parameters.
from
langchain.document_loaders.onedrive
import
OneDriveLoader
loader
=
OneDriveLoader
(
drive_id
=
"YOUR DRIVE ID"
,
object_ids
=
[
"ID_1"
,
"ID_2"
],
auth_with_token
=
True
)
documents
=
loader
.
