What is Vectara?
Vectara Overview:
Vectara is developer-first API platform for building conversational search applications
To use Vectara - first
sign up
and create an account. Then create a corpus and an API key for indexing and searching.
You can use Vectara’s
indexing API
to add documents into Vectara’s index
You can use Vectara’s
Search API
to query Vectara’s index (which also supports Hybrid search implicitly).
You can use Vectara’s integration with LangChain as a Vector store or using the Retriever abstraction.
Installation and Setup
#
To use Vectara with LangChain no special installation steps are required. You just have to provide your customer_id, corpus ID, and an API key created within the Vectara console to enable indexing and searching.
VectorStore
#
There exists a wrapper around the Vectara platform, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore, whether for semantic search or example selection.
To import this vectorstore:
from
langchain.vectorstores
import
Vectara
To create an instance of the Vectara vectorstore:
vectara
=
Vectara
(
vectara_customer_id
=
customer_id
,
vectara_corpus_id
=
corpus_id
,
vectara_api_key
=
api_key
)
The customer_id, corpus_id and api_key are optional, and if they are not supplied will be read from the environment variables
VECTARA_CUSTOMER_ID
,
VECTARA_CORPUS_ID
and
VECTARA_API_KEY
, respectively.
For a more detailed walkthrough of the Vectara wrapper, see one of the two example notebooks:
