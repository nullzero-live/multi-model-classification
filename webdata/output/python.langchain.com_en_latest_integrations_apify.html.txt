Apify
#
This page covers how to use
Apify
within LangChain.
Overview
#
Apify is a cloud platform for web scraping and data extraction,
which provides an
ecosystem
of more than a thousand
ready-made apps called
Actors
for various scraping, crawling, and extraction use cases.
This integration enables you run Actors on the Apify platform and load their results into LangChain to feed your vector
indexes with documents and data from the web, e.g. to generate answers from websites with documentation,
blogs, or knowledge bases.
Installation and Setup
#
Install the Apify API client for Python with
pip
install
apify-client
Get your
Apify API token
and either set it as
an environment variable (
APIFY_API_TOKEN
) or pass it to the
ApifyWrapper
as
apify_api_token
in the constructor.
