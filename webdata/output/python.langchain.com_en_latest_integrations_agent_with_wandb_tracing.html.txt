Tracing Walkthrough
Tracing Walkthrough
#
There are two recommended ways to trace your LangChains:
Setting the
LANGCHAIN_WANDB_TRACING
environment variable to “true”.
Using a context manager with tracing_enabled() to trace a particular block of code.
Note
if the environment variable is set, all code will be traced, regardless of whether or not it’s within the context manager.

# A url with for the trace sesion like the following should print in your console:

# The url can be used to view the trace session in wandb.
# Now, we unset the environment variable and use a context manager.
