What is Metal?

Metal is a  managed retrieval & memory platform built for production. Easily index your data into
Metal
and run semantic search and retrieval on it.
Quick start

Get started by
creating a Metal account
.
Then, you can easily take advantage of the
MetalRetriever
class to start retrieving your data for semantic search, prompting context, etc. This class takes a
Metal
instance and a dictionary of parameters to pass to the Metal API.
