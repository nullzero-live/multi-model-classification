Argilla
is an open-source data curation platform for LLMs.
Using Argilla, everyone can build robust language models through faster data curation
using both human and machine feedback. We provide support for each step in the MLOps cycle,
from data labeling to model monitoring.
Installation and Setup
#
First, youâ€™ll need to install the
argilla
Python package as follows:
pip
install
argilla
--upgrade
If you already have an Argilla Server running, then youâ€™re good to go; but if
you donâ€™t, follow the next steps to install it.
If you donâ€™t you can refer to
Argilla - ðŸš€ Quickstart
to deploy Argilla either on HuggingFace Spaces, locally, or on a server.
