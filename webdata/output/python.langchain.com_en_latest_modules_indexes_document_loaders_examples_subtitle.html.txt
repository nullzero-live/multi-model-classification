The SubRip file format
is described on the
Matroska
multimedia container format website as “perhaps the most basic of all subtitle formats.”
SubRip
(SubRip
Text)
files are named with the extension
.srt
, and contain formatted lines of plain text in groups separated by a blank line. Subtitles are numbered sequentially, starting at 1. The timecode format used is hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds with time units fixed to two zero-padded digits and fractions fixed to three zero-padded digits (00:00:00,000). The fractional separator used is the comma, since the program was written in France.
