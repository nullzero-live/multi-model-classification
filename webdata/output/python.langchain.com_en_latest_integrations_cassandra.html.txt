Cassandra
is a free and open-source, distributed, wide-column
store, NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers,
providing high availability with no single point of failure.
Cassandra
offers support for clusters spanning
multiple datacenters, with asynchronous masterless replication allowing low latency operations for all clients.
Cassandra
was designed to implement a combination of
Amazon's
Dynamo
distributed storage and replication
techniques combined with
Google's
Bigtable
data and storage engine model.
