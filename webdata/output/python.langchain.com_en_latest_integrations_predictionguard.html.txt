Basic LLM Chaining with the Prediction Guard:
Prediction Guard
#
Prediction Guard
gives a quick and easy access to state-of-the-art open and closed access LLMs, without  needing to spend days and weeks figuring out all of the implementation details, managing a bunch of different API specs, and setting up the infrastructure for model deployments.
Installation and Setup
#
Install the Python SDK:
pip
install
predictionguard
Get an Prediction Guard access token (as described
here
) and set it as an environment variable (
PREDICTIONGUARD_TOKEN
)
LLM
#
from
langchain.llms
import
PredictionGuard
Example
#
You can provide the name of the Prediction Guard model as an argument when initializing the LLM:
pgllm
=
PredictionGuard
(
model
=
"MPT-7B-Instruct"
)
You can also provide your access token directly as an argument:
pgllm
=
PredictionGuard
(
model
=
"MPT-7B-Instruct"
,
token
=
"<your access token>"
)
Also, you can provide an “output” argument that is used to structure/ control the output of the LLM:
pgllm
=
PredictionGuard
(
model
=
"MPT-7B-Instruct"
,
output
=
{
"type"
:
"boolean"
})
